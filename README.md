# DOSE-RF
Dose Outcome using Stratified Estimation with Random Forest  <br/>
*Mollie Payne*

## Overview 
DOSE-RF is a novel two-stage procedure designed to estimate the causal effect of treatment dosage, specifically in scenarios where adherence to treatment (such as the number of psychotherapy sessions attended) varies among participants. This method extends traditional approaches by leveraging **Random Forest classification** to predict treatment adherence and using **Principal Stratification** to estimate the dose-response relationship without making strong assumptions about the shape of the dose-response function.
